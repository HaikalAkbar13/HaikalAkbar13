I am a third-year student at Institut Turatea Indonesia, majoring in Development Economics, with a growing passion for the data industry, particularly in data analysis. 

My academic journey has strengthened my understanding of the critical role data plays in decision-making processes. Through my studies, I’ve developed a keen interest in analyzing economic data to uncover patterns and insights that drive organizational success.

Courses in macro and microeconomics have further deepened my interest in exploring the relationships between variables like poverty rates, inflation, and educational outcomes. These experiences, combined with my knowledge of Python, SQL, and data visualization, have equipped me to tackle complex datasets with precision and creativity.

With strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and a curious mindset, I am actively pursuing a career in data analytics. I am eager to apply my abilities to contribute meaningfully to an organization, helping to turn data into actionable strategies.
